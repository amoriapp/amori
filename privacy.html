                    commitment, you can focus on building meaningful connections.
                </p>
                <p>We appreciate that you put your trust in us when you provide us with your information and we do not
                    take this lightly.</p>

                    services with your privacy in mind. We work hard to make sure that no decision is taken without
                    respect for your privacy.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">We work hard to be transparent in the way we process your data. </span>We have
                    written our Privacy Policy and related documents in plain language, stripped of unnecessary legal
                    and technical jargon. We actually want you to read our policies and understand our privacy
                    practices!
                </p>
                <p><span class="bold">We strive to keep your information secure. </span>We are dedicated to keeping your
                    data safe and secure. We strive to constantly update our security practices and invest in our
                    security efforts to enhance the safety of your information.</p>
                <h2>Amori Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>Welcome to Amori’s Privacy Policy (“Policy”). Thank you for taking the time to read it! </p>
                <p>We appreciate that you trust us with your information and intend to always keep that trust. We want
                    to start this building this trust by ensuring that you understand the information we collect, why we
                    collect it, how it is used, and the choices you have regarding your data. This Policy explains how
                    we collect, store, protect, and share your information, and with whom we share it. We suggest you
                    read this in conjunction with our Terms and Conditions of Use. While you're enjoying the Amori
                    mobile application ("App"), we collect some information about you. In addition, you may choose to
                    use the App to share information with other users of the App, including your friends and contacts
                    ("Users"). We may also need to share your information sometimes.</p>
                <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation
                    to this Policy. The personal information that we collect is used for providing and improving the
                    App. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
                    Policy. Because Amori is based in the United States, keep in mind that your information will be sent
                    to and used in the United States regardless of the country you reside in.
                </p>
                <h3>Where This Privacy Policy Applies</h3>
                <p>The Policy applies to websites, apps, events and other services operated by Amori. For simplicity, we
                    refer to all of these as our “services” in this Policy.
                </p>
                <p>Some services may require their own unique privacy policy. If a particular service has its own
                    privacy policy, then that policy — not this Policy — applies.</p>
                <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                <h4>Information You Give Us</h4>
                <p>When you download the App and create an account ("Account"), we may collect certain information
                    ("Registration Information") about you, including, but not limited to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Name;</li>
                    <li>Email;</li>
                    <li>Mobile number;</li>
                    <li>Gender identity;</li>
                    <li>Date of birth;</li>
                    <li>Phone number;</li>
                    <li>Password;</li>
                    <li>Sexual preference;</li>
                    <li>Photographs;</li>
                    <li>Location; and</li>
                    <li>Email, Name and Profile Picture from social media accounts that you connect to your Amori
                        Account (this could include, for example, your Facebook account ("Social Media Accounts").</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The information we collect helps to enhance the App and verify our Users. Registration Information
                    including but not limited to your name and photo may be visible to the public on your profile page.
                    To better enhance your experience, we process your chats with other users as well as the content you
                    publish, as part of the operation of the services.
                </p>
                <h4>Information We Receive From Others About You</h4>
                <p>In addition to the information you provide us directly, we receive information about you from others,
                    including:</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Other Users: </span>Other users may provide information about you as they use our
                    services. For instance, we may collect information about you from other users if they contact us
                    about you.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Social Media: </span>You may be able to use your social media login (such as
                    Facebook Login) to create and log into your Amori account. This saves you from having to remember
                    yet another user name and password and allows you to share some information from your social media
                    account with us. We will never post to your Facebook account or share any information from using our
                    app on your Facebook without your explicit permission.
                </p>
                <h4>Log and Usage Data</h4>
                <p>We may collect information about your device when you use the App including, but not limited to the
                    unique device identifier, device model, operating system, and MAC address. In addition, if you
                    permit us to do so, the App may access your device's address book solely in order to add someone to
                    your contacts.</p>
                <p>We collect information about your activity on our services, for instance how you use them (e.g., date
                    and time you logged in, features you’ve been using, searches, clicks and pages which have been shown
                    to you, referring webpage address, advertising that you click on) and how you interact with other
                    users (e.g., users you connect and interact with, time and date of your exchanges, number of
                    messages you send and receive).</p>
                <p>If you give us permission, we can collect your precise geolocation (latitude and longitude) through
                    various means, depending on the service and device you’re using, including GPS, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
                    connections. The collection of your geolocation may occur in the background even when you aren’t
                    using the services if the permission you gave us expressly permits such collection. If you decline
                    permission for us to collect your geolocation, we will not collect it.
                </p>
                <p>In a case of an error in the App, we might collect data and information on your phone called Log
                    Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
                    device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing our App, the time
                    and date of your use of the App, and other statistics.</p>
                <h4>AI Chatbot (Amori Bot) and Conversation-Based Learning</h4>
                <p>Amori utilizes an AI chatbot called "Amori Bot" within the App that learns and adapts based on user conversations. The Amori Bot analyzes user interactions, preferences, and behaviors to provide personalized experiences and dating advice, and to improve the quality of matches. Please note the following privacy implications related to the Amori Bot:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection: The Amori Bot may collect and analyze information shared during conversations with users, including personal preferences, interests, and other relevant data, to optimize the user experience and improve match suggestions. Furthermore, by pressing “I Allow” when Amori Bot asks if it can know about your conversations, the user also allows Amori Bot to collect information shared during conversations with other users.
                    </li>
                    <li>Personalization: The Amori Bot uses the collected data to tailor recommendations and suggestions within the App. It may utilize machine learning techniques to understand user preferences better and provide more relevant content and matches.
                    </li>
                    <li>Data Protection: We take the privacy and security of your data seriously. Any personal information shared during conversations will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to protect your data from unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.</li>
                    <li>Anonymized and Aggregated Data: To further improve our services, we may anonymize and aggregate the data collected through the Amori Bot for analytical and statistical purposes. This ensures that individual users cannot be personally identified from the processed data during our research and development.</li>
                    <li>User Control: You have control over the information you share with the Amori Bot and with other users. You can choose the extent to which you engage in conversations and provide personal details. You can also request the deletion of your data as outlined in the "Data Retention & Deletion" section of this Privacy Policy.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>User Control: Opting Out of Amori Bot Data Collection</h4>
                <p>We understand that some users may prefer not to have their conversations contribute to the data collection process for the Amori Bot. When users first get on the app, they can say “Maybe later” to the Amori Bot, and it will not collect data from their conversations with other users. We also provide an option to opt out of data collection from conversations through the "Amori Bot Learning" toggle in the Account section of the Settings page on the App. By disabling this toggle, you can choose not to have your conversations used for further learning and improvement of the AI algorithm. Please note that opting out of data collection from conversations may impact the personalized experience and match suggestions provided by the Amori Bot. However, other functionalities of the App will remain unaffected by this choice.</p>
                <p>Please be aware that while we strive to make the Amori Bot experience as accurate and helpful as possible, it may not always provide perfect matches or recommendations. The bot's suggestions are based on available data and algorithms, and its understanding may not fully capture the nuances of human communication.</p>

                <h3>Cookies</h3>
                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers.
                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
                    internal memory.
                </p>
                <p>This App does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the App may use third party code and
                    libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option
                    to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
                    choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this App.</p>
                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information; thus, we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the
                    internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its
                    absolute security.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Policy Regarding Age</h3>
                <p>Although we want as many people as possible to enjoy our creation, you have to be at least 18 years
                    old to use the App.</p>
                <p>Amori does not knowingly collect any information about or market to children, minors or anyone under
                    the age of 18. If you are less than 18 years old, we request that you do not submit information to
                    us. If we become aware that a child, minor or anyone under the age of 18 has registered with us and
                    provided us with personal information, we will take steps to terminate that person's registration
                    and delete their Registration Information from Amori. If we do delete a profile because you violated
                    our no children rules, we may retain your email and IP address to ensure that you do not try to get
                    around our rules by creating a new profile.
                </p>
                <h3>Service Providers</h3>
                <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

                <ul>
                    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
                    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
                    <li>To perform Service-related services; or
                    </li>
                    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal
                    Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are
                    obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
                <h3>Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
                <p>We keep your personal information only as long as we need it for legitimate business purposes and as permitted by applicable law. If you decide to stop using our services, you are able to close your account, and your profile will stop being visible to other users.</p>
                <p>To protect the safety and security of our users, we implement a safety retention window of 3 months. It is possible to restore your account during this period in case it was accidentally deleted or deactivated. During this period, we keep your information in the event that it might be necessary to investigate unlawful or harmful conducts. The retention of information during this safety retention window is based on our legitimate interest as well as that of potential third-party victims. After the retainment period, we delete your data and only keep limited information for specified purposes, as laid out below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We maintain limited data to comply with legal data retention obligations. In particular, we keep transaction data (if you make purchases within the app) for 10 years to comply with tax and accounting legal requirements. We may also need to keep “traffic data” / logs for one year to comply with legal data retention obligations. We also keep records of consents users give us for five years to evidence our compliance with applicable law.</li>
                    <li>We maintain limited information for legitimate business interests such as data necessary to prevent members who were banned from opening a new account, for as long as necessary to ensure the safety and vital interests of our members.</li>
                    <li>We maintain information in cases where there is an outstanding or potential issue, claim or dispute requiring us to keep information (in particular if we receive a valid legal subpoena or request asking us to preserve data (in which case we would need to keep the data to comply with our legal obligations) or if data would otherwise be necessary as part of legal proceedings).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you believe that the information we hold about you is inaccurate or that we are no longer entitled to use it and want to request its rectification, deletion, object to or restrict its processing, you can submit a request for the deletion of personal information by contacting us at <a href="mailto:info@amori.app">info@amori.app</a>. For your protection and the protection of all of our users, we may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity before we can answer the above requests.</p>
                <h3>Changes To This Policy</h3>
                <p>As Amori evolves, we may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of
                    the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be available to you. If we make a
                    change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you, for example,
                    via an email to the email associated with your Account or by posting a notice within Amori. By
                    continuing to access or use the App after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by
                    the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
                <h3>How To Contact Us</h3>
                <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at
                    <a href="mailto:info@amori.app">info@amori.app</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>Your access to the App, as well as this Privacy Policy, are governed and interpreted by the laws of
                    the State of California, other than such laws, rules, regulations and case law that would result in
                    the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of California. By using the App,
                    you are consenting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and the State of
                    California. You agree that such courts shall have in personam jurisdiction and venue and waive any
                    objection based on inconvenient forum. You agree that you will not file or participate in a class
                    action against us. In the event there is a discrepancy between this English language version and any
                    translated copies of the Policy, the English version shall prevail.</p>
                <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
